Given a set of digits, return the biggest palindromic number writable with the digits.

A palindromic number is a number that has the same value when read from left to right, and from right to left.

Note that you don't have to use all digits of input.
Input
a single line containing unsorted digits from 0 to 9.
Output
The biggest palindromic number writable with these digits. No leading zeros are allowed.
Constraints
1 ≤ number of digits ≤ 100
At least one digit is non-zero
Example
Input
11299
Output
91219


Python solution:
import sys
import math

# Auto-generated code below aims at helping you parse
# the standard input according to the problem statement.

digits = input()
l=[]
s=''
for d in sorted({*digits}):
    c=digits.count(d)
    if c%2:
        s=d
        c -=1
    l+=[d,c],

print(l,file=sys.stderr)
l.sort()


for *_,d,c in l:
    d:str
    c:int
    s=d*(c//2)+s+d*(c//2)
    

# Write an answer using print
# To debug: print("Debug messages...", file=sys.stderr, flush=True)

print(s.strip('0'))
