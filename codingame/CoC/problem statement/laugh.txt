CodinGame scientists are working on several promising topics. One of them is a research on the quality of laugh.

In this research they record the human speech, extract the laugh from it and analyze it.
Fortunately, the scientists already made the software which converts speech to text s with length n.

Consider a string of alternating letters “h” and “a” to be a laugh. The quality of laugh is maximum in a speech when it has the longest *substring considered as a laugh. Since you are the leading scientist in this research, it's up to you to find this longest substring.
Note: 1 Single Character a or h is NOT a laugh.


Test 1 Explanation:
ahaba It is optimal to select substring aha. Print the length of this substring, which is 3.

*Substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. Or in other words, a substring is obtained by deleting zero or more characters from the beginning of the string and at the end of the string.
